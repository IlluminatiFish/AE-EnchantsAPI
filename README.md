# AE-EnchantsAPI
Fork of EnchantsAPI for AdvancedEnchantments

Same methods to check for enchantments and get the level as the old EnchantsAPI which was based off lore https://github.com/IlluminatiFish/EnchantsAPI
Now includes a command /checkenchant <enchantment> which checks if the item you are holding has the enchant you passed through the command
