Fork of EnchantsAPI for AdvancedEnchantments

Same methods to check for enchantments and get the level as the old EnchantsAPI which was based off lore https://github.com/IlluminatiFish/EnchantsAPI but now based off of NBT 

Commands:
  
  - /checkenchant [enchantment] - Checks if the item you are holding has the enchant you passed through the command
  - /removeenchant [enchantment] - Removes the enchantment you passed through the command from the item you are holding.
